# Store-Transactions-Statistics

This is a project I have developed for the AxonSoft internship

The marketing department of a company wants to extract a series of statistics from payments:
- the average value of payments
- number of payments with value <= 5000 RON
- number of payments by customers under 18 years
- total sum of payments made by romanian citizens born in Bucharest
- number of non-romanian citizens that efectuated payments

The input data consists of a csv file, entries separated by ;, each entry containing:
- CNP (Social Security Number)
- payment value
